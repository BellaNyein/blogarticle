				<h3 class="ms-4">What is Menopause?</h3>
				<p class="ms-4">Women have always been known to have great intuition, especially when it comes to their body reacting to
                    certain conditions - emotionally, mentally or physically.<br><br>
                    These “feelings” tend to get “out of control” during specific phases of our life, the kind that we see in movies but
                    have not explicitly discussed before it happens.<br><br>
                    We start to sense a shift in the way our body works; drastic mood swings with frequent tears or outbursts.
                    </p>
				<br/> <h5 class="ms-4">The worst part?</h5>
				
				<p class="ms-4">
					The way people start reacting to this outburst, responding like they <i>think we’re going crazy.</i>
                    <br>Honestly, we are not going crazy… It's just menopause!
                    <br><br>
                    Menopause is a transitional period when our bodies start to wind down on our reproductive abilities.
                    <br><br>
                    And it’s no fun ride. All the mood swings, hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, joint pains, and the <i>never-ending
                        list of problems</i>. Feels like we have a lot to deal with, by ourselves.
                    <br><br>
                    But...
                    <br><br>
                    Understanding and accepting these symptoms can help us <b>simplify the process</b> of solving them (as promised,
                    as easy as 1, 2, 3)!

						<h4 class="text-center">Perimenopause</h4>
						<p class="mt-4">Perimenopause or Premenopause can begin <b>several years before menopause</b>. This could last between a few
                            months to about 10 years. However, on average it lasts about 4 years.
                            <br>
                            <br>What happens?<br>
                            <br><b>Ovaries start to gradually lower estrogen production.</b>
                            <br>This is a natural process of growing older and usually starts around the age of 40. In some cases, it could start as
                            early as when women are in their 30s.
                            <br>
                            <br>This could mean a reduction in our fertility rate, therefore, women looking to start a family should try and utilize
                            every open opportunity with their partner!
                            <br>
                            <br><b>Changes in the menstrual/period cycle</b>
                            <br>The horror stories begin with the change in duration of our menstrual cycle- there could be longer gaps between
                            periods or spotting between 2 cycles.
                            <br>
                            <br>Like, the frustration of not knowing when you will get your period next is not enough; the flow would differ too,
                            making it heavier or lighter over time.
                            <br>
                            <br><b>Intensified PMS (premenstrual syndrome)</b>
                            <br>Drastic and frequent mood swings are the most common signals, along with increased insomnia or hot flashes.
                            <br>
                            <br>This could increase our irritability level, losing our energy levels; getting tired even after sitting at work the entire
                            day or taking longer weekend naps to recover from our workweek would be common.

						<h4 class="text-center">Menopause</h4>
						<p class="mt-4">The official menopause stage begins 12 months after the last menstrual period (bleeding).
                            <br>What happens?
                            <br>
							<br/><b>Ovaries stop releasing eggs</b>
							<br/>This means there would be minimal production of estrogen.<br>
							<br>At this stage, getting pregnant could be significantly harder. Hence, we notice the use of hormonal therapy or IVF
                            for childbirth.	<br/>
							<br>We start feeling “low”, with the constant need to cuddle in bed and watch Netflix instead of going out and getting
                            drinks with our girlfriends.
							<br>
                            <br><b>Intensified hot flashes and night sweats.</b>
                            <br>
                            Waking up in the middle of the night, aggressively throwing our blanket away or turning your fan on max even
                            though the aircon is on full blast.
                            <br>
                            <br>Our body starts to feel warm or hot suddenly, with flushed red skin and increased heart rate; followed by
                            suddenly feeling cold.
                            <br>
                            <br><b>Significant physical changes</b>
                            <br>The concept of “a minute on your lip, a lifetime on your hip” comes to reality. Eating one slice of cake for dinner
                            could increase weight around our waist and abdominal region, with a reduction in our metabolic rate."
                            <br>
                            <br>It is also common to notice our hair and skin becoming drier and thinner; no amount of conditioner and lotion
                            seem to absolutely solve this problem.
                            <br>

						<h4 class="text-center"><b>Postmenopause</b></h4>
						<p class="mt-4">Yes, the troubles don’t end right at menopause. It is the stage where most of the severe menopausal symptoms
                            decrease but it comes with additional side effects.
                            <br>
                            <br>What happens?
                            <br><b>Increase in Follicle Stimulating Hormones (FSH)</b>
                            <br>This increases dramatically as our ovaries shut down and drastically lower the level of estrogen in our body.
                            <br>
                            <br>By this point, we started noticing a lowered energy level - sleeping in by 7/8 P.M. after work is a norm.
                            <br>
                            <br><b>Higher risk of certain health conditions.</b>
                            <br>
                            <br>Some of the common health problems that occur during postmenopause are diabetes, joint pains, osteoporosis,
                            cholesterol and heart disease.
                            <br>
                            <br>This could be an alarming phase, where every visit to the doctor is like drawing a lottery ticket- we need to
                            maintain a healthy lifestyle to combat such possibilities.
                            <br>
                            <br><b>Difficulty concentrating and memory lapses (often temporary)
                            </b>
                            <br>Forgetting your car keys, deadlines seem to increase over time. However, these are temporary symptoms of
                            postmenopause.
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>We face a reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic factors which could also cause depression and anxiety.
                            Now we have identified the 3 stages of Menopause.
                            <br>
                            <br>Understanding the 3 most common symptoms amongst women is vital, allowing us to solve or reduce these
                            problems.

							<br/>2. <b>Bloating & Weight Gain </b>
							<br/>3. <b>Joint Pains & Anxiety/Depression </b>

                            <br>
                            <br>Going through menopause by yourself is hard! Especially because it affects our daily life! Symptoms like
                            reduction in metabolic rates and estrogen levels that cause weight gain and increase the size of our abdomen;
                            night sweats and flashes, joint pains that make us feel 30 years older...are just to name a few.
                            <br>
                            <br>Therefore, we have broken down understanding and solving menopause in 3 easy steps; which can make this
                            journey a little less frustrating!
                            <br>
                            <br>We hope you can see that menopause does not have to be difficult and solving it can be as easy as 1, 2, 3!
                            <br>
                            <br>We at Better Body Co have a mission to help women around the world have an easier menopausal transition...
